          Not to brag, but Meru initiated the ride- hailing revolution in India
          where customers could easily have an AC cab at their doorstep with a
          single call. This goes way back in time when the black and yellow
          taxis (Kaali-peeli taxis) largely dominated our city roads.

              Meru’s journey began in 2000, when its founder, Mr. Neeraj Gupta
              established a Staff Transportation business under the name
              ‘V-Link’ with a single bus contract with Tata Infotech Ltd. What
              started out as a humble beginning was soon to revolutionize
              mobility in India.
            </span>
            <span>
              By the year 2006, V-Link became the Largest Staff Transportation
              Company in India with a fleet of over 1500 vehicles across 7
              cities. A year later, Meru was launched with the first fleet of
              cabs integrated with electronic meters and GPS/GPRS systems.

              Radio Cabs headed out to conquer the ride hailing market in India
              from bustling streets of Mumbai.

              that was the talk-of-the-town and soon expanded its services to
              the top 4 cities of India with a fleet of 5000 taxis. Meru was an
